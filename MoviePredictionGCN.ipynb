The data is collected from a TigerGraph database using a Python package [pyTigerGraph](https://github.com/parkererickson/pyTigerGraph). Data collected is then pushed through a GCN to output predictions about a person's viewing preferences. This example does makes a couple oversimplifications that will be pointed out, mainly in the assumptions made surrounding a person's preferences. \n",
